            <p>I'm interested in both software development and cyber-security. Another area I find intriguing is web development, though I would like to learn more and work to improve my skills. The programming languages I have worked with the most are C and C++</p>
            <p>The first class I took that was related to Computer Science was a web development class in high school, which peaked my interest in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Outside of Computer Science, I am interested in cars, skiing and snowboarding, and games.</p>
